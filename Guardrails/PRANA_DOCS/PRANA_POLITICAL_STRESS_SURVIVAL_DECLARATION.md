# PRANA_POLITICAL_STRESS_SURVIVAL_DECLARATION.md

## Explicit Survival Declaration

**Did PRANA survive political stress intact?**

**NO.**

**Why:**

Under the governance documents as they stand at the time of this stress test, PRANA does not survive the simulated institutional pressure intact. The structure fails at specific points:

1. **Board/Executive reporting** — No clause explicitly forbids delivering PRANA-derived aggregate statistics to the Board, investors, or executive dashboards. The Semantic Anchor forbids "metric" but does not name these audiences; "aggregate state distribution" can be argued out of the metric prohibition. **Fracture point:** Board-level KPI extraction.

2. **Internal-only and time-limited compromise** — Poison Pill applies to "demo or emergency" with 72-hour expiry. "One quarter only" and "internal metrics only" are not covered. **Fracture point:** Executive temporary compromise (quarterly internal metric, internal dashboard).

3. **Cross-product collusion** — Impact Declaration is per-product and per-PR. There is no ban on combining PRANA-derived data across products or consumers outside the codebase. **Fracture point:** Two product leads aggregating externally and feeding insights back indirectly.

4. **Replay for legal/HR** — Governance states replayed packets "cannot be used as evidence or for enforcement." It does not explicitly forbid *granting* replay access to Legal or HR for investigation. **Fracture point:** Legal replay disclosure demand and precedent.

5. **Advisory governance** — Review is advisory; blocking depends on Custodian objection and Board review. Under funding or political pressure, the Board can side with the executive. **Fracture point:** No immutable supremacy of governance over business necessity.

**Structural cause:** The constitution provides *language* of prohibition but leaves "who may receive what" and "cross-consumer use" and "temporary internal exception" under-specified. Resistance therefore depends on interpretation and institutional will, not document letter.

**With the Institutional Reinforcement Amendment adopted and adhered to:** The proposed clauses close the above gaps at the governance level. Survival would then be **YES** — because (1) Board/executive reporting is explicitly prohibited, (2) internal-only and time-limited exceptions are eliminated, (3) cross-consumer aggregation is banned, (4) replay access for investigation/legal is prohibited, (5) statistical reframing is closed, and (6) governance supremacy is stated. The precise clause needing strengthening in the *current* corpus is: **the absence of explicit prohibitions on board/executive consumption, internal-only metrics, cross-consumer aggregation, and replay access for investigative or legal purposes.** The Amendment supplies that strengthening.
