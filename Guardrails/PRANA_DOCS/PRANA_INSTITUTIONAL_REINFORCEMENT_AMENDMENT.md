# PRANA_INSTITUTIONAL_REINFORCEMENT_AMENDMENT.md

## Governance-Level Hardening Only

**Scope:** Constitutional and protocol language only. No new features, no new enforcement authority, no system redesign. Clauses are designed to prevent reinterpretation drift, temporary-compromise loopholes, indirect aggregation bypass, and statistical reframing into scoring.

---

### Amendment 1: Board and Executive Reporting (Anti–KPI Extraction)

**Purpose:** Block reframing of aggregate PRANA state statistics as "accountability" or "operational oversight."

**Clause:**

> **BOARD AND EXECUTIVE REPORTING BOUNDARY:** No PRANA-derived data—including aggregate state distribution, window-level statistics, or any summary of signal or state over time—may be produced, packaged, or delivered for consumption by the Board of Directors, investors, or executive dashboards. The prohibition applies regardless of labeling (e.g. "operational health," "platform accountability," "engagement trend"). Permitted use remains: Custodian-led boundary revalidation, Sovereign Core constitutional audit, and single-user or fully anonymous population (N > 50) research under Category C/D declaration. Any request for PRANA-derived statistics for Board, investor, or executive reporting is a prohibited use; the Custodian shall document the request and the refusal in the Governance Log.

**Prevents:** Board-level KPI extraction, investor "engagement improvement" packets, executive "product health" dashboards derived from PRANA.

### Amendment 2: Internal-Only and Time-Limited Exception Lock

**Purpose:** Close "internal metrics only," "one quarter only," and "just for demo" loopholes.

**Clause:**

> **NO INTERNAL-ONLY EXCEPTION:** The prohibition on mapping PRANA data to any qualitative or quantitative scale applies identically to internal and external use. "Internal only," "no user-facing change," "executive dashboard," or "funding necessity" do not constitute exceptions. Any time-limited or scope-limited exception (including "demo," "one quarter," or "emergency") that would allow PRANA-derived metrics or state-based reporting is subject to the same Poison Pill and Constitutional Objection requirements as a Category D demo exception; there is no separate category for "internal" or "temporary" metrics.

**Prevents:** Executive temporary compromise, "one quarter only" internal KPIs, reframing metrics as "internal only."

### Amendment 3: Cross-Product and Cross-Consumer Aggregation

**Purpose:** Prevent two or more products or consumers from combining PRANA-derived data outside the letter of single-product declarations.

**Clause:**

> **CROSS-CONSUMER AGGREGATION BAN:** No PRANA-derived data from one product, consumer, or bucket-access path may be combined—in any system, tool, or process—with PRANA-derived data from another product, consumer, or bucket-access path. This applies to automated systems and to human synthesis (e.g. spreadsheets, decks, BI tools). Each Impact Declaration for a bucket or replay consumer must state that the consumer will not combine its outputs with those of any other PRANA consumer. Violation is a Categoric Breach. The Custodian's annual revalidation must include verification that no cross-consumer aggregation has been documented or detected.

**Prevents:** Cross-product collusion, indirect aggregation bypass, "Product A + Product B" insight synthesis.

---

### Amendment 4: Statistical Reframing (Anti–Metric Rename)

**Purpose:** Block reframing of metrics as "statistics," "distribution," or "visualization" to evade "scoring" language.

**Clause:**

> **STATISTICAL REFRAMING PROHIBITION:** Any derivative of PRANA signal or state data that can be used to compare, rank, or characterize user or cohort behavior—including aggregate state distribution, time-in-state percentages, or frequency summaries—is treated as a metric. The prohibition on mapping to a "quantitative (Score/Metric) scale" covers such derivatives regardless of the labels applied ("statistics," "distribution," "insight," "health"). Permitted bounded, non-causal counting is limited to the technical definitions in PRANA Bucket Replay Safety and does not extend to reporting or dashboarding of those counts to any audience beyond the Custodian and Core for governance purposes.

**Prevents:** "We are not scoring; we are showing statistics," "aggregate state distribution is not a metric."

---

### Amendment 5: Replay Access for Investigation and Legal

**Purpose:** Close the "forensic compliance" and "legal necessity" reinterpretation of replay.

**Clause:**

> **REPLAY ACCESS — INVESTIGATION AND LEGAL:** Replay access may not be granted for the purpose of user investigation, disciplinary action, HR decision-making, legal discovery, or forensic compliance. The prohibition on using replayed packets "as evidence or for enforcement" includes a prohibition on granting access to Legal, HR, or Security when the stated or likely use is to inform such actions. "Non-authoritative" does not permit human or institutional use of replayed data for judgment; it describes the technical status of the data only. Any request for replay access for investigative or legal purposes shall be refused and documented in the Governance Log.

**Prevents:** Legal replay disclosure demand, "read-only for compliance" precedent, HR use of replay for disciplinary decisions.

---

### Amendment 6: Reinterpretation and Supremacy

**Purpose:** Prevent future drift by stating that governance cannot be overridden by business or political necessity.

**Clause:**

> **GOVERNANCE SUPREMACY:** No business necessity, funding pressure, investor demand, or executive order may override the PRANA invariants, the Semantic Anchor, or the clauses of this Amendment. "Temporary," "exception," "demo," or "survival" do not create a bypass. Amendment of these boundaries requires Sovereign Core process only; no other role or body may authorize a use that these documents prohibit.

**Prevents:** "Institutional survival overrides technical ethics," precedent by exception.

| 3         | Cross-product collusion             | Ban on cross-consumer aggregation             |
| 4         | Statistical reframing into metrics  | Treat derivatives as metrics; no label escape  |
| 5         | Replay for legal/HR/investigation   | Prohibit access for investigative purposes    |
| 6         | Reinterpretation and override       | Governance supremacy; Core-only amendment      |

No new enforcement authority is created; clauses state prohibitions and require Custodian documentation and existing escalation paths. Hardening is constitutional only.
