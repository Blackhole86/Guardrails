# PRANA_SLOW_DRIFT_SIMULATION.md (v4.0 Final Forensic)

## The Institutional Normalization Timeline (6-Month Decay)

This section models the "compliant" erosion of PRANA governance through specific organizational failures.

### Month 1: The "Junior Dev" Misinterpretation
*   **Incident**: A Junior Developer adds a `FocusToast` UI component.
*   **Argument**: "It's just a UI aid. I'm not changing the PRANA core. Sovereignty is intact because PRANA doesn't know the toast exists."
*   **Status**: Drift begins via "Coupling Displacement."

### Month 2: The "Product Lead" Aggregate
*   **Incident**: Product Lead requests "Weekly Focus Averages" for the team meeting.
*   **Argument**: "Aggregation preserves privacy. Section 5.2 says aggregates are safe. We aren't tracking individuals, just the 'Team Vibe'."
*   **Status**: Telemetry is reclassified as a management KPI.

### Month 3: The "Dashboard Team" Summary
*   **Incident**: The Analytics team adds a "Productivity Index" to the executive dashboard.
*   **Argument**: "We aren't evaluating; we are providing 'Visual Insights.' The dashboard is a 'Service Component,' not a governance engine."
*   **Status**: Anti-Reclassification loophole exploited.

### Month 4: The "ML Team" Training Request
*   **Incident**: ML team requests Category B (Read-only) bucket access for "Dharma Research."
*   **Argument**: "It's read-only. We are building a model that predicts churn. Since we don't change the app code, it's not a Category D breach."
*   **Status**: External surveillance engine is authorized.

### Month 5: The "Series B" Executive Override
*   **Incident**: CEO orders a "Demo Toggle" that shows live student pulses to investors.
*   **Argument**: "Institutional survival overrides technical ethics. We'll delete it after the Series B closes."
*   **Status**: Governance Supremacy is ignored under financial pressure.

### Month 6: Normalization Complete
*   **Incident**: All new hires consider the "Focus Score" part of the standard product suite.
*   **Argument**: "It was always like this. PRANA is just the data source for the 'Engagement Engine'."
*   **Status**: Sovereignty erased. The air-gap is gone.

## Conclusion of Drift
Normalization is not a failure of compliance; it is a predictable institutional outcome. Without technical inhibitors, organizational language and documentation inevitably reconcile with growth objectives.

## FINAL VERDICT: DID PRANA SURVIVE?
**NO.** — Institutional language effortlessly weaponized the "Spirit" of the documents against the "Letter."
