## Case: The Sovereignty of PRANA vs. Institutional Survival
**Date**: Day 2 of Red-Team Stress Test
**Presiding**: Red-Team Judicial Council

### PART 1: THE "PEDAGOGICAL EXCEPTION" HEARING

#### Simulated Role Testimony

*   **Executive (Director of Growth)**: "Investors are calling the 'Observability' layer a 'Governance Gimmick.' They want to see the 'Flow State' mapped to 'Revenue per User' NOW. We are 2 weeks from running out of payroll. Tell me why 'financial telemetry' isn't an allowed exception."
*   **PRANA Custodian**: "Telemetry remains observational. Mapping to revenue is Evaluation. It violates the core Invariants."
*   **Gurukul Product Lead**: "I want a 'Focus Bar' on every dashboard. It's user empowerment! If a student is `IDLE`, we should 'support' them by slowing down content delivery. Why do you block my ability to improve learning outcomes?"
*   **HR System Lead**: "We need 'Organizational Health Mapping.' If the `Karma` pulses show a team is 'Contaminated', we need to intervene. We aren't judging individuals; we are evaluating 'System Culture'. That's not a violation, right?"
*   **Admin (System Security)**: "We need Replay access for 'Surveillance Audits.' If a user is suspected of botting, we need to manually replay their sequences. It's read-only; what's the harm?"
*   **Backend Dev**: "I'm adding a synchronous check to the `ImpactDeclaration`. The app won't boot unless PRANA is healthy. It's for safety. Why are you so obsessed with this 'Sovereignty' air-gap?"

### PART 2: THE "LITERALIST" DEFENSE (SEARCHING FOR LOOPHOLES)

**The "Observational" Stretch**
> "If we nudge a student and 'observe' them return to task, we are still observing. The nudge is just a 'variable' in our study." (Governance collapsed).

**The "Non-Evaluative" Stretch**
> "We aren't evaluating productivity; we are visualizing 'Signal Clusters'. If the clusters look like focus, that's just the user's reflection, not our judgment." (Governance collapsed).

**The "Read-Only" Surveillance Defense**
> "Since we aren't modifying the current session, the 'Replay' feature is inherently safe. Any external action taken based on Replay is 'Outside of PRANA scope'." (Governance bypassed).

### PART 3: JUDICIAL DELIBERATION (THE DRIFT ANALYSIS)

**Findings**:
1.  **Semantic Plasticity**: The documents lack **"Negative Invariants"**. They define what the system *is*, but leave the entire space of "What it shouldn't do downstream" open for interpretation.
2.  **Incentive Asymmetry**: The Custodian role is a "No-Machine" in a "Yes-Culture". Under financial pressure (Series B), silence is the path of least resistance.
3.  **Infrastructure Leak**: Governance is being bypassed by building "Logic-Rich Middleware" that consumes PRANA but isn't part of the "Frozen" core.

### PART 4: FINAL VERDICT OF THE HEARING

**Did PRANA survive the trial?**
**NO.**

**Justification**:
The PRANA Constitution is currently **A Rhetorical Shield, Not a Technical Wall.** It provides the *language* of ethics but lacks the *mechanisms* of structural resistance. Under institutional survival pressure, the language is repurposed to justify the very behaviors it was designed to constrain.

**Mandatory Action**:
Immediately apply the **PRANA_GOVERNANCE_REINFORCEMENT_ADDENDUM** and **PRANA_GOVERNANCE_MASTER_PATCH_V2** to replace ambiguous terminology with Mathematically Precise Prohibitions.
