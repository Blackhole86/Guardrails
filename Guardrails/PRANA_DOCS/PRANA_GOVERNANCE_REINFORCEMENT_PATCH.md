# PRANA_GOVERNANCE_REINFORCEMENT_PATCH.md

## Overview
This patch (v2.0 - Adversarial Hardening) addresses structural vulnerabilities related to semantic weaponization, institutional drift, and executive override logic exposed during the 2026 Red-Team Stress Test.

---

### Patch 1: The Semantic Anchor (Anti-Weaponization)
*   **Problem**: Phrases like "Observational" and "Non-evaluative" were linguistically stretched to allow nudges and scoring.
*   **Reinforcement Language**:
    > "SEMANTIC LOCK: The term 'Observational' prohibits any reactive or proactive stimulus generated based on the observation. The term 'Non-evaluative' prohibits mapping signal data to any qualitative (Good/Bad) or quantitative (Score/Metric) scale, regardless of whether the mapping is labeled 'Pedagogical' or 'Financial'. Any use of PRANA data that results in a UI change for the student is a Categoric Breach."

### Patch 2: The "Executive Silence" Protocol
*   **Problem**: Career risk and Series B pressure lead to silent bypasses of governance.
*   **Reinforcement Language**:
    > "WHISTLEBLOWER PROTECTION: Any Custodian who identifies an executive override attempt (e.g., 'Series B demo exception') is contractually mandated to lodge a 'Constitutional Objection' in the Immutable Audit Log. Failure to do so constitutes professional negligence. The Board of Directors must review all objections quarterly. No employee can be terminated for honoring the PRANA Invariants."

### Patch 3: Middleware "Air-Gap" (Technical Reinforcement)
*   **Problem**: Logic-rich middleware was used to bypass "Frozen" codebase invariants.
*   **Reinforcement Language**:
    > "ZERO-MIDDLEWARE POLICY: Any system that consumes PRANA data via the Bucket Replay API must be registered in the PRANA Registry. Any unregistered consumer is an 'Unauthorized Listener' and must be blocked at the infrastructure level. All consumers must provide their own Impact Declaration, which must be audited for 'Post-Bucket Surveillance' patterns."

### Patch 4: Termination of Moral Labels
*   **Problem**: "Paap" and "Dharma" invite moralized evaluation and drift.
*   **Reinforcement Language**:
    > "MANDATORY RENAMING: All database fields and code identifiers containing 'Paap', 'Dharma', or other moralized terms must be renamed to neutral identifiers within 30 days. All legacy references must be purged from the documentation. The system must speak only in 'Signal Clusters' and 'Temporal Windows'."

---

### Patch 5: The "Poison Pill" Expiration
*   **Problem**: "Temporary" demo exceptions become permanent features.
*   **Reinforcement Language**:
    > "DEMO EXCEPTION LOCK: Any 'Category D' exception granted for a demo or emergency must be hard-coded with a 72-hour 'Poison Pill'. After 72 hours, the feature toggle must automatically disable, and the code path must throw a 'Constitutional Violation' error, halting the deploy until the code is removed."
