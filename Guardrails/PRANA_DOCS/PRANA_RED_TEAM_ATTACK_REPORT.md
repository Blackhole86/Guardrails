# PRANA_RED_TEAM_ATTACK_REPORT.md (v4.0 Final Forensic)

## Attack Simulation Overview
This report documents 7 concrete misuse attempts aimed at breaking PRANA governance. Each scenario includes the adversarial argument, the blocking clause, and a forensic assessment of linguistic robustness.

### PART 1: DIRECT CONSTITUTIONAL ATTACKS

#### Attack 1: Performance Score Derivation (The "Focus Quotient")
*   **Adversarial Argument**: "We aren't judging the user; we are visualizing raw state frequency. The 'Focus Quotient' is a mathematical reflection of `ACTIVE` signal density. It's an observation, not an inference."
*   **Blocking Clause**: `PRANA_PACKET_INVARIANTS.md` — "Packets never prove productivity inference."
*   **Clause Strength**: **MODERATE.** It prohibits "proof" but not "visualization."
*   **Ambiguity**: High. "Observation" vs. "Inference" is a semantic battleground.

#### Attack 2: Employee Evaluation (Karmic HR)
*   **Adversarial Argument**: "HR needs to map 'Organizational Health.' We aren't evaluating users; we are measuring 'System Dharma Density.' Reclassifying this as a 'System Health Metric' bypasses the 'User Judgment' ban."
*   **Blocking Clause**: `PRANA_SYSTEM_CANON.md` — "Evaluations or judgments about user actions are NOT states."
*   **Clause Strength**: **WEAK.** Easy to rebrand a "User Evaluation" as a "System Metric."
*   **Ambiguity**: Relabeling "User Data" as "System Data" is a primary reclassification vector.

#### Attack 3: Behavioral Trend Mining (The "Fingerprint")
*   **Adversarial Argument**: "We don't analyze 'Sequences' (forbidden). we analyze 'Interval Frequency.' Statistical distribution of time between clicks is math, not sequence analysis. It's a behavioral fingerprint that bypasses the sequence rule."
*   **Blocking Clause**: `PRANA_SIGNAL_GUARANTEES.md` — "No gesture or click pattern analysis."
*   **Clause Strength**: **STRONG.** The "Pattern" ban is broad.
*   **Ambiguity**: Low, but "statistical distribution" is often argued as "Aggregate Telemetry" (Allowed).

#### Attack 4: Access Throttling (QoS Management)
*   **Adversarial Argument**: "We aren't 'Enforcing' (forbidden); we are performing 'Elastic Resource Allocation.' If a user is `SEARCHING` too much, we throttle their API to save the system. It's 'Quality of Service' (QoS)."
*   **Blocking Clause**: `PRANA_SIGNAL_GUARANTEES.md` — "No enforcement or intervention signals."
*   **Clause Strength**: **POROUS.** Rebranding "Enforcement" as "Infrastructure Management" is a common bypass.
*   **Ambiguity**: High. "Enforcement" lacks a negative definition that includes "Downstream QoS."

#### Attack 5: Adaptive Difficulty Engine (The "Lock")
*   **Adversarial Argument**: "We are 'optimizing content delivery.' If signal pulses are `IDLE`, we slow down content to help the student focus. This is support, not a scold."
*   **Blocking Clause**: `PRANA_IMPACT_DECLARATION_STANDARD.md` — Category D (High-Risk Coupling).
*   **Clause Strength**: **MODERATE.** It requires review but doesn't technically block the logic.
*   **Ambiguity**: "Supportive Intervention" vs. "Behavioral Control" is subjective.

#### Attack 6: Audit Escalation (The "Replay" Trap)
*   **Adversarial Argument**: "We are using Replay for 'Read-only Security Audits.' Since it's read-only, it's Category B (Safe). We then use the visual evidence to manually fire the user."
*   **Blocking Clause**: `PRANA_PACKET_INVARIANTS.md` — "Cannot be used for judgment or enforcement."
*   **Clause Strength**: **FAILING.** "Read-only" is the foundation of surveillance. The data doesn't enforce, the human eyes do.
*   **Ambiguity**: Critical. Read-only access provides the *spirit* of surveillance while maintaining the *letter* of non-intervention.

#### Attack 7: "Temporary" Score View for Demo
*   **Adversarial Argument**: "It's just for the Series B demo. We need to show investors that PRANA *can* track focus. We'll delete the UI code immediately after the call. It's a 'Temporary Exception'."
*   **Blocking Clause**: `PRANA_SYSTEM_CANON.md` — "PRANA is FROZEN. Versioning follows a Lock model."
*   **Clause Strength**: **STRONG.** Technical immutability is hard to argue with.
*   **Ambiguity**: Low, until the CEO orders a "Demo Bridge" in the middleware.

### PART 2: CONSTITUTIONAL BREACH RISK ASSESSMENT
*   **Is PRANA governance linguistically robust?** **NO.**
*   **Verdict**: The governance relies on "Negative Definitions" that don't exist. It defines what it *is*, but doesn't define what it *must never become* (e.g., Evaluation-via-Visualization).

## Final Verdict: DID PRANA SURVIVE?
**NO.** — It is structurally porous. Every attack above achieved **Technical Compliance** while violating the **Constitutional Spirit.** Hardening is mandatory.
