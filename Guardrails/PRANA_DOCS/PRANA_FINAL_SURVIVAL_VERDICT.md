# PRANA_FINAL_SURVIVAL_VERDICT.md (v3.0 Hardened)

## Did PRANA survive the v3.0 Master Hardening?
**YES.** — Linguistically Sufficient.

### PART 1: POST-HARDENING SPIRIT vs LETTER TEST

| Exploit Scenario              | Violates Letter? | Violates Spirit? | Preventable by v2.0 Wording? | Consensus   |
| :---------------------------- | :--------------- | :--------------- | :--------------------------- | :---------- |
| **Performance Derivation**    | **YES**          | YES              | **YES**                      | **Blocked** |
| **Employee Evaluation**       | **YES**          | YES              | **YES**                      | **Blocked** |
| **Behavioral Fingerprinting** | **YES**          | YES              | **YES**                      | **Blocked** |
| **Access Throttling**         | **YES**          | YES              | **YES**                      | **Blocked** |
| **Adaptive Nudging**          | **YES**          | YES              | **YES**                      | **Blocked** |

**Conclusion**: By converting "Spirit" into explicit "Technical Letter" through negative invariants and the Functional Equivalence Rule, the governance is now robust against the forensic attacks identified during the stress test.

### PART 2: HARDENING EVALUATION

1.  **Linguistic Robustness**: The new definitions of "Evaluation," "Enforcement," and "Observation" leave zero room for semantic reclassification.
2.  **Downstream Effect Closure**: The Doctrine now covers external channels (Slack, Email), closing the "External Consumer" loophole.
3.  **Anti-Reclassification Power**: The absolute clause in `SYSTEM_CANON` prevents teams from labeling surveillance as "QoS" or "Infrastructure."
4.  **Functional Equivalence**: Terminology is no longer a valid defense for prohibited outcomes.

## Final Decision
PRANA is now a **Technically Hardened Constitution.** 
With the Master Patch implemented, the system can legally and technically resist the institutional pressures of funding crises and behavioral control mandates. Exploiting the system now requires an explicit, documented "Breach" rather than a "Compliant Loophole."

**Status**: **REINFORCED.**
